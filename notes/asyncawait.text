// blocking code 
blocks the flow of the program
read file syncronously

untill the file is read the program is blocked 

//NOn-Blocking code
        does not block the execution
        example: suppose you get a data from an user and
        you have to store it in the database then give a
        success message here the success message will
        be delivered without considering whether the
            data has been write or not and if error occurs
            it will be not responsible
